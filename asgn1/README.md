## Instructions for building an executable:
```bash
$> cd asgn1
$> make
```
This will create an executable named "lexer" in the asgn1/bin directory. 

## Running the executable: 
```bash
$> bin/lexer <file>
```
where <file> is the path to the code that you want to run the lexer on. 

Sample test codes have been included under the asgn1/test subdirectory. They can be run as follows:
```bash
$> bin/lexer test/test1.cs
```
