=========================================
Instructions for building an executable:
=========================================

$> cd asgn1
$> make

This will create an executable named "lexer" in the asgn1/bin directory. 

=========================
Running the executable: 
=========================

$> bin/lexer <file>

where <file> is the path to the code that you want to run the lexer on. 

Sample test codes have been included under the asgn1/test subdirectory. They can be run as follows:

$> bin/lexer test/test1.cs
